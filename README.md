# mqllock
C/C++ backend

MQLLock.com project was created to protect MetaTrader4 ex4 files from decompilation when MT4 itself didn't have that protection.
Also licensing was added to protect vendors from stealing their code and unwanted scripts usage.

Though DLL was protected with VMProtect, it contained internal protection. 
These sources can be interested for the ones who ever tried to crack protected files.
